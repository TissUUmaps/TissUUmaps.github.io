#### Automated identification of the mouse brain's spatial compartments from in situ sequencing data

Spatial organization of tissue and cell types characterizes biological function, and spatially resolved gene expression has the power to reveal variations in this organization, with high resolution. Here, we show how in situ sequencing data combined with dimensionality reduction and clustering can be used to identify spatial compartments that correspond to known anatomical compartments of a mouse brain, replacing the need of manual annotation based on cell and tissue morphology. Here we visualize decoded spatial transcriptomic and gene expression defined compartments on a mouse brain coronal section.
We thank Xiaoyan Qian for kindly providing in situ sequencing raw data.
