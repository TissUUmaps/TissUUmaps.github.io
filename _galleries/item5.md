#### Prostate cancer project STHLM3

The large number of prostate biopsies coupled with a shortage of uro-pathologists places a strain on pathology departments, and high intra- and inter-pathologist variability in Gleason grading leads to potential under- and overtreatment of prostate cancer. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods may help to alleviate these problems by reducing the workload and by harmonising pathology assessments. \
We developed an AI system for automatic detection of biopsy cores with prostate cancer and for assisting diagnostics by estimating the location and Gleason grade of tumour regions. We used 6,682 biopsies from 976 men during model development and training, and 1,630 biopsies from 245 men as an independent test set for evaluation. The biopsies were collected in 2012-2015 as part of the population based prospective diagnostic trial Stockholm-3, and subsequently digitized.
