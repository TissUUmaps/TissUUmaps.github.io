With the emergence of high throughput single cell techniques, the understanding of cellular diversity in biologically complex processes has rapidly increased. The next step towards comprehension of e.g. key organs in the mammal development is to obtain spatiotemporal atlases of the cellular diversity. However, targeted cell typing approaches relying on existing single cell data achieve incomplete and biased maps that could mask the molecular and cellular heterogeneity present in a tissue slide. Here we applied spage2vec, a de novo approach to spatially resolve and characterize cellular diversity during human heart development. Data from the original in situ sequencing experiment as well as identified cell types can be viewed in TissUUmaps.
