#### Automated identification of the mouse brain's spatial compartments from in situ sequencing data

Spatial organization of tissue and cell types characterizes biological function, and spatially resolved gene expression has the power to reveal variations in this organization, with high resolution. Here, we show how in situ sequencing data combined with dimensionality reduction and clustering can be used to identify spatial compartments that correspond to known anatomical compartments of the brain. We also visualize gradients in gene expression and sharp as well as smooth transitions between different compartments. We apply our method on mouse brain sections and show that computationally defined anatomical compartments are highly reproducible across individuals and have the potential to replace manual annotation based on cell and tissue morphology. Mapping the brain based on molecular information means that we can create detailed atlases independent of angle at sectioning or variations between individuals.
