An increasing volume of prostate biopsies and a worldwide shortage of urological pathologists puts a
strain on pathology departments. Additionally, the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability in grading can
result in overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer. To alleviate these problems, we aimed to develop an
artificial intelligence (AI) system with clinically acceptable accuracy for prostate cancer detection, localisation, and
Gleason grading. Here we show examples of full-resolution digitized biopsies and corresponding AI-based grading.
