### Human Developmental Lung Cell Atlas

The human lung is a highly complex tubular organ, whose main function is the gas exchange between blood and breathed air. In contains a large number of specialized cell-types of epithelial, endothelial, neuronal, stromal and immune cells that are necessary for normal organ function and structural integrity. To understand how this cell heterogeneity develops to create a healthy mature lung, we focused on the 1st trimester of gestation and applied state of art technologies to capture the gene expression profiles of all the cells in the developing organ, in time and space.
