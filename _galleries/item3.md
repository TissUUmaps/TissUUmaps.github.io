Spage2vec is an unsupervised segmentation free approach for decrypting the spatial transcriptomic heterogeneity of complex tissues at subcellular resolution. Spage2vec represents the spatial transcriptomic landscape of tissue samples as a graph and leverage powerful machine learning graph representation technique to create a lower dimensional representation of local spatial gene expression. Here we visualize spage2vec localized gene expression signatures of different spatial transcriptomic datasets.
