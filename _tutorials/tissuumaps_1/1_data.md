In this video we see what TissUUmaps can do and what data we can visualize and explore. TissUUmaps allows the display of tissue slide images and uses an overlay to display any sort of marker data on top. Be it spatially resolved gene expression, per cell data, or regions of interest.

Any image can be converted to a pyramidal image and point TissUUmaps to it so it can be displayed, it is not limited to tissue data but it is its main purpose. The images are not used for processing or extracting information only visualization. Since the images are displayed via the web, only 8-bit images can be displayed. If you have a different bit-depth you will need to convert it to 8-bits before using VIPS.
