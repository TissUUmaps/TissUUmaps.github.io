TissUUmaps is designed to display and share spatially resolved data on top of a whole slide tissue image. Any kind of image and markers 
can be visualized and shared with anyone via web-browser without downloading the image data or installing any software. 

You and your collaborators can also interact with the data. You can visualize spatial transcriptomics, in-situ sequencing, and data associated with cells, like morphology or cell types. 
All on top of the tissue to create some interesting tissue maps!
