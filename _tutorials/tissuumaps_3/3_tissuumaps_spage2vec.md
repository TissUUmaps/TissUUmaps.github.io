This tutorial will show you how to integrate a code from Jupyter notebook with our interactive viewer TissUUmaps. For this example we use the method Spage2vec - unsupervised segmentation-free approach for decrypting the spatial transcriptomic heterogeneity of complex tissues at subcellular resolution.

You can find the Jupyter Notebook in: <a href="https://github.com/TissUUmaps/FlaskTissUUmaps/blob/master/examples/spage2vec_TM.ipynb"> spage2vec_TM.ipynb </a>.
