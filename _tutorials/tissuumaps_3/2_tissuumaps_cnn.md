TissUUmaps allows to visualize convolutional neural network (CNN) on multiresolution images. In this tutorial, we show how to extract morphological features from any spatial transcriptomics (ST) dataset using any pretrained CNN. In the end, we will have a vector of features for every ST spot in the image, that we can then reduce to 3 dimensions and map back to the image as RGB colors.

You can find the Jupyter Notebook in: <a href="https://github.com/TissUUmaps/FlaskTissUUmaps/blob/master/examples/tissuumaps_cnn_example.ipynb"> tissuumaps_cnn_example.ipynb </a>.
