In this video, we show how to use TissUUmaps to visualize the outputs from two well known ST analysis frameworks: Giotto and Squidpy.

The original tutorial for analyzing 10X Visium (Giotto) can be found  <a href="spatialgiotto.rc.fas.harvard.edu/giotto.visium.brain.html"> here</a>, and the code for integration with TissUUmaps in <a href="https://github.com/TissUUmaps/FlaskTissUUmaps/blob/master/examples/giotto2tmap.py"> giotto2tmap.py</a>.

The original tutorial for Analyze Visium H&E data (Squidpy) can be found  <a href="https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/auto_tutorials/tutorial_visium_hne.html"> here</a>, and the code for integration with TissUUmaps in <a href="https://github.com/TissUUmaps/FlaskTissUUmaps/blob/master/examples/squidpy2tmap.ipynb"> squidpy2tmap.ipynb</a>.
